# Background
This repository is dedicated to the creation of my dashboard showcasing AZ511 data. AZ511 is a website that contains traffic data in the state of Arizona. This includes data such as car accidents, road closures, construction, etc. I was inspired to create this project due to witnessing a lot of events on the Arizona highways. The API I connected to obtain this data was through AZ511. You can find their website here: https://www.az511.com/. 

# Tools & Languages 
I used the Microsoft Fabric software to complete an end-to-end analytics process. I extracted and transformed the data using a Python script in a notebook. I loaded this data through a data connection in PowerBI. PowerBI is my data visualization tool of choice due to it's easy integration with the Microsoft Fabric software. 

- Extract: Python Notebook 
- Transform: Python Notebook
- Load: Data Connection via PowerBI

# Process 
1) Create an account to request API credentials.
2) After receiving credentials, create a Python notebook to perform ETL on the data.
3) Create a data connection between Fabric and PowerBI.
