#Background
This repository is dedicated to the creation of my dashboard showcasing AZ511 data. I was inspired to create this project due to witnessing a lot of events on the Arizona highways. The API I connected to obtain this data was through AZ 511. You can find their website here: https://www.az511.com/. 

#Tools & Languages 
I used the Microsoft Fabric software to complete an end-to-end analytics process. I extracted and transformed the data using a Python script in a notebook. I loaded this data through a data connection in PowerBI. PowerBI is my data visualization tool of choice due to it's easy integration with the Microsoft Fabric software. 

Extract: Python Notebook 
Transform: Python Notebook
Load: Data Connection via PowerBI
